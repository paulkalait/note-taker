  ## Description
  This Project was using express.js to a create server to run the front-end starter code files. I created routes that complimented the correct methods in the starter code files. The routes I created were an app.get to tell the sever to display the static html page, app.post to create new notes and modify existing array, and app.delete to delete notes by targeting the note's property id. I used the splice() method to delete the notes array. This project was also beneficial because I became familiar with deploying my site via heroku.
